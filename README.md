# Project Happy Thoughts API

API and Mongo Database done with Node.js and express, for Happy Thoughts, a site to post and read happy messages. The database lets you post message, a username and tags, and lets you like existing messages.  

## The process

I did the basic functionality first, to post and read messages to MongoDB and checked with Postman that everything worked as intended. Then added a few extra feautures, like adding a name and some tags to the message.
